My Experiments to automate a model railway.

I have inherited some old Marklin digital control boxes.
This re-started my model railway hobby which has been a old fascination of mine.
I came to the conclusion that the available Software no longer supported the 6050 serial interface.
As I do no have a high budget to spend so decided to build he software to control the track myself.

So although the software is not complete as other available programs is is purely a hobby project to
automate my track.

I have decided to share it on Github, because I think there might be more railway enthusiasts who have
fun in automating things them self.

So it was time to leave the 6050 and replace it for a Marklin CS2.
I has started to implement the CAN command over the network.
Currently the followin command work, but ist is still a work in progress.

Stop, GO, switch an accessory, drive a Locomotive
Get feedback information from the S88 events.

Wishlist:
Get a list of locomotives from the CS2. Should be possible , but don't yet know how tips are welcome.
State of all feedback contacts when not changed.

A GUI which is build using NetBeans forms.

So I hope you get inspired
