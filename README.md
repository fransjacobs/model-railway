My Experiments to automate a model railway.

The program is trying to be a dashboard for a Mearklin CS2/3. as I find the screen a bit tiny.
So I am developing screens for
* a layout overview
* control multiple locomotives
* Turnout and Signals overview
* Diagnosic screen to seet what is happening on the track and the communication between the CS2/3 and the PC.

This project started as (and still is) hobby to automate my model rail layout.

The Project started using the old Mearklin digital control boxes (6021/6050).
I came to the conclusion that the on the market available Software no longer supported the 6050 serial interface.
Which is to be expected as it is very old. 

So the project evaluated and I obtained a CS2. So a new chanlange was there to be able to communicate with the CS2.
So it is progressing an I am buiding this just for my own fun. 
I have decided to share it on Github, because I think there might be more railway enthusiasts who have
fun in automating things them self.

So I hope you get inspired
