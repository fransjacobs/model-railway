## üöÇ About JCS

Java Central Station (JCS) is my personal passion project to bring a model railway to life with software.  
With JCS you can draw your layout, place trains on the tracks, and watch them move from block to block ‚Äî either under your manual control or fully automated.  

I started this project out of curiosity (and fun!) to see how far I could take automation on a model railroad without relying on closed, commercial systems. Along the way, it has grown into a full tool that:

- Works with real hardware like DCC-EX, M√§rklin CS2/CS3, ESU ECoS, and HSI-S88.  
- Lets you run in Autopilot mode or drive manually with a Driver Cab.  
- Shows live sensor and switch feedback on your layout.  
- Includes a Virtual Command Station, so you can try things out even without hardware.  

The goal isn‚Äôt to compete with professional products, but to create something open, extendable, and fun ‚Äî for anyone who loves tinkering with trains and code. üöâ‚ú®

## üéØ Why This Project?

Most commercial solutions for model railway automation feel like a **black box** ‚Äî powerful, but closed, rigid, and sometimes overkill for hobby layouts.  

I started **JCS** because I wanted something different:  

- A project where I could **learn by building**.  
- A chance to **experiment freely** with new ideas.  
- And above all‚Ä¶ to **have fun running trains**! üöÇ‚ú®  

By making JCS open source, I hope it can also inspire other hobbyists:  

- Tinkerers who want to peek under the hood.  
- Builders who want to extend it with their own features.  
- Or simply anyone looking for a free and flexible alternative for their layout.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Connects to command stations**: M√§rklin CS2/CS3, ESU ECoS, DCC-EX, and HSI-S88.  
- **Draw your layout**: An interactive graphical editor to design your tracks, blocks, and sensors.  
- **Run trains automatically**: Let the Autopilot handle routing and block control.  
- **Or drive them yourself**: Use the built-in Throttle / Driver Cab for manual control.  
- **See what‚Äôs happening in real time**: Live feedback from sensors, switches, and blocks.  
- **Test without hardware**: A Virtual Command Station lets you experiment on screen.  
- **Remote visibility**: Built-in VNC viewer for M√§rklin CS3 and ESU ECoS systems.  

> Whether you want to hand the controls to Autopilot, or keep your hands on the throttle, JCS makes your layout come alive.
